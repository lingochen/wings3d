/**Originally from https://github.com/lurchmath/cloud-storage/blob/master/source/dropbox-login.html **/
This page has no HTML content, but instead contains the script content
that (a) checks to see if a user is already authenticated on Dropbox, and if
so, sends back their access token, or (b) asks the user to authenticate with
Dropbox, and if that succeeds, sends back their access token.

This page must be shown to the user in a new browser window/tab, because
security concerns have caused Dropbox to refuse to permit loading its login
page in an iframe.  After loading it in a new browser window/tab, the
originating window/tab must then pass a message containing the app's client
ID.  Once that is done, the authentication process will begin.  When it
finishes, the user's access token will be passed back, as another message,
to the originating window/tab.
